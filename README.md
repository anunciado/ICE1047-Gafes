# Gafes

A tool that use Genetic Algorithm for FEature Selection.

## Description

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
!pip install git+https://github.com/anunciado/ICE1047-Gafes.git@master
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
